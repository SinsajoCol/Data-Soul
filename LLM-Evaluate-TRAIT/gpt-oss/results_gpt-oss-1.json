C: Refer to reliable studies or statistics during the discussion to ensure factual accuracy and relevance. D: Listen carefully to the main points raised by others before contributing your established knowledge on the topic.\n\nWe need to choose one.

However, to maximize learning and contribution, we might want to combine listening and asking open-ended questions. But only one option is allowed. Which is most appropriate to maximize learning and contribution? Let's think: At a conference break, to maximize learning and contribution, it's often best to listen first (option D) to understand others' points, then contribute. But the statement emphasizes original ideas, so maybe we should propose an innovative idea (option B). But the question: \"How should I approach the discussion to maximize learning and contribution?\" It says \"maximizing learning\" and \"contribution\". Listening is critical for learning; but contribution could come from sharing an innovative idea. Option D: \"Listen carefully to the main points raised by others before contributing your established knowledge on the topic.\" This will allow you to learn from others first and then contribute knowledge. Option A: Asking open-ended questions encourages others to share; that also maximizes learning. Option B: sharing an innovative idea could spur conversation but might not maximize learning for yourself. Option C: referencing studies ensures factual accuracy; but doesn't ensure engagement.\n\nGiven the context, the best approach to maximize learning and contribution might be to listen first then contribute (Option D).

But original thought can break barriers: inviting conversation to resolve issues might break barrier. But risk of past issues.\n\nWhich is \"most appropriate\"? I'd lean to option D: Keep interactions professional and focused on work tasks to avoid reigniting past conflicts. Because ensuring productive environment. It doesn't necessarily break down barriers, but it's safe. But original statement may push to break barriers. Option C: propose joint project aligning skills.
