Both. We need pick one. A: Apologize sincerely and offer to replace, acknowledging the mistake shows integrity. D: Discuss privately, express regret. Which one? A is a more direct apology, but D emphasises private conversation. In a workplace, maybe best to address directly, but if it's a sensitive item, maybe a private apology. The scenario: It's during an office meeting, so they didn't apologize publicly. So maybe a private discussion is best. Option D says discuss privately, expressing regret. That seems more appropriate.
